Hey folksðŸ‘‹, Itâ€™s good to write to you again.

November and December were eventful months for me, filled with lessons and progress worth celebrating.

In this letter, Iâ€™ll share what weâ€™ve been up to over the past two months, our challenges, and our plans for the new year.

## Key Highlights

[Nuxt SaaS Kit](https://nuxtsaaskit.com/?ref=peoray.dev), our SaaS boilerplate for Nuxt developers, continued to gain traction. November and December were about experimenting with marketing.

Some of the steps I took included:

- Responding to Reddit posts about boilerplates.

- Sharing updates on X (formerly Twitter).

- Submitting to directories.

Things I failed to do:

- Writing blog posts.

- Building free tools.

- Creating video demos.

One decision we made for Nuxt SaaS Kit is to remove the agency-related custom pricing since no one has shown interest in them.

Seeing people purchase something we built is an incredible feeling that never fades. However, it was also a lesson in the importance of consistent marketing. When I wasnâ€™t actively engaging online, sales dried up. But whenever I showed up, whether by tweeting or responding to questions, there was noticeable traction.

Iâ€™ll be honest; marketing isn't my natural strength, and putting yourself out there comes with its share of vulnerability. However, these months have proven that showing up consistently, despite the discomfort, directly impacts results.

Itâ€™s not easy putting yourself out there; reaching out to strangers can feel daunting. But, as I learned, _nobody will know about your work if you donâ€™t talk about it_. Itâ€™s uncomfortable at first, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.

This period brought a change of scenery as I travelled quite early for the holidays. This trip provided an invaluable opportunity to work in person with my co-founder. Together, weâ€™ve been reflecting on the year and planning for 2025.

Admittedly, I did less work in December due to family commitments and holiday activities. However, it was the perfect time to pause, recharge, and set the stage for whatâ€™s next.

## Okikelabs Website

Since I started this newsletter, I have written very little about Okikelabs. After building in relative silence with my co-founder, I'm excited to share more about Okikelabs. I set up a simple [website](https://okikelabs.com/?ref=peoray.dev), creating a dedicated space to showcase what we are [building](https://okikelabs.com/blog/hello-world/?ref=peoray.dev).

## Looking Ahead to 2025

As a company, weâ€™re setting ambitious goals for next year, including:

- Launch new products.

- Improve our marketing efforts for new and existing products.

I wrote a year-in-review post on the Okikelabs blog. If youâ€™re curious about how 2024 went for us, you can check it out [here](https://okikelabs.com/blog/year-in-review-2024/?ref=peoray.dev).

On a personal front, my focus in 2025 will be heavily on Okikelabs. My actions will be geared towards achieving growth and ensuring we reach our company goals.

Some of the goals Iâ€™d like to achieve include:

- Grow my personal brand.

- Work full-time on Okikelabs.

I had hoped to write a proper year-in-review article on my website but havenâ€™t gotten to it yet. At this point, I may shift focus to outlining my goals for 2025 instead. Hopefully, Iâ€™ll do so before the next issue of the newsletter for January is published.

## Final Thoughts

When I started this newsletter, my goal was to document my journey, sharing the struggles, lessons and wins along the way. The biggest takeaway so far is that showing up and staying consistent can make all the difference and that **_marketing is king_**.

Iâ€™m excited about what lies ahead in 2025 and grateful to have you all following me on this journey. If you have any feedback, ideas, or even name suggestions for this newsletter, Iâ€™d love to hear them.

Hereâ€™s to building and thriving in 2025!

Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰.
