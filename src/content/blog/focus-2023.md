As the dawn of a new year breaks, many of us find ourselves reflecting on the past and contemplating the future. It is usually a time for self-assessment, evaluation and making plans.

Unlike in [2019](/blog/things-i-dont-know-2019) and [2020](/blog/tech-to-learn-2020), where my focus has been on technologies to learn and new languages and frameworks to pick, this year, my focus revolves around pragmatism and deliberation, guided by a set of objectives within areas where I can make a tangible difference.

- **Publish more articles:** In my [last article](/blog/digital-garden), I outlined my plan for adopting a digital garden mindset for my blog to enable me to publish more frequently without striving for perfectionism. I hope to spend more time writing articles for myself rather than tweaking my website design and adding unnecessary features.

- **Embrace just-in-time learning:** In the past, Iâ€™ve tried to learn everything about a new tech stack before I started using it, which often led to being overwhelmed and giving up. Additionally, I have wasted time learning numerous languages and frameworks that I rarely put into practice and eventually forget. This year, I will only invest my time in learning new languages and frameworks if I see a need for them. I will prioritize practical application over acquiring knowledge for the sake of it.

- **Become a creator:** To share my knowledge, insights, and experiences, I will embrace various avenues of creativity. These include:
  - Writing Articles: I will focus on producing articles that provide practical solutions, in-depth explanations, and valuable insights within my areas of expertise.

  - Developing npm Packages: I intend to create and release npm packages that solve common problems or enhance existing frameworks and libraries, contributing to the developer community.

  - Designing Starter Themes: To facilitate efficient project kick-starts, I will craft starter themes for popular frameworks, allowing developers to begin their projects with a solid foundation.

  - Speaking: By actively participating in speaking engagements, conferences, or meetups, I aim to share my knowledge and experiences with a broader audience.

- **Open source contributions:** I aim to foster engagement and increase my involvement within the open-source community. These include contributing to existing projects, collaborating with other developers, and potentially starting and maintaining my own open-source projects. By actively participating in OSS, I aim to give back to the community and enhance my skills.

- **Building a Personal Project:** To apply my knowledge and skills effectively, I will undertake a personal project that aligns with my interests and serves a practical purpose. By working on a meaningful project, I can challenge myself, learn new technologies, and showcase my abilities to potential employers.

By focusing on these objectives, I hope to optimize my time and be the best version of myself in 2023. This blog post serves as a public to-do list that I can look back on at the end of the year, hopefully with a sense of pride and accomplishment.
