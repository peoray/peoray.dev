## WHAT IS IT?

This is a challenge that was created by Alexander Kallaway and he first wrote this [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) about it. Since then, it has garnered so much support in the field that it has now become a norm, especially for beginners like myself. The goal of the whole challenge as highlighted by Kallaway is to ensure you code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days. Challenging right? The goal is to find the motivation to make coding a habit.

## WHY AM I DOING IT?

After months of speculation, I have decided to join the #100DaysofCode challenge. This will not be the first time I will be committing to this, first time I got halfway but unfortunately school and exams got in the way and I couldn’t keep up.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysofCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysofCode</a> tomorrow.<br>Follow my daily log on github <a href="https://t.co/Q6es5GT2xW">https://t.co/Q6es5GT2xW</a></p>&mdash; Emmanuel Raymond (@peoray_) <a href="https://twitter.com/peoray_/status/858427384349044737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At that stage, my coding experience isn’t as it is now and I wasn’t feeling the level of motivation I feel now. Also, I was alone, didn’t have mentors, friends who code or anyone to push me, I was all alone and that was a big factor. But I’m glad I’m doing it now, I mean there is no better time than now and I hope to start and finish without missing a day.

My goal is to grow and improve my skills, as this challenge will help me keep track of my activities. Also, by doing this challenge, I hope to tackle my bad habit of starting a project and abandoning it half-way. I want to be able to build projects to show off in my portfolio and build my confidence overall.

I hope to achieve the following the following goals during this time:

- Improve my JavaScript skills

- Improve my CSS abilities (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Animations, transitions, transforms, etc.)

- Getting comfortable using Sass

- Start[ #30Days30Sites](http://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites)

- Learn Vue.js

- Learn new tips and tricks.

- Finish at Least five online courses (preferably Udemy)

- Write technical blog posts.

- Build stuff. Lots of them!!!

![A goal without a plan is just a wish](../images/blog/100-days-of-code/plan.jpeg)

Well, I’m pumped up and I can’t wait to see how this turns out. You can follow my daily [tweets](https://twitter.com/super_raay/status/950187188104454145) or check out my daily log on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/peoray/100-Days-Of-Code). Also, you can check out my [learning tracker](https://github.com/peoray/My-Learning-Tracker) to keep up to date with my progress. I will be writing about my experience about the challenge in the next 100 days from today. So until then, Happy Coding!
