August wasn’t the smooth ride I had hoped for. While [July](/blog/july-2024-new-beginnings) was all about momentum and laying the groundwork, August reminded me that progress doesn’t always follow a straight line. We had the ambitious goal to launch Nuxt SaaS Kit, our Vue/Nuxt starter kit designed to help developers launch production and market-ready SaaS products quickly. Unfortunately, we ran into some significant roadblocks that derailed our plans.

## Facing Unexpected Delays

Despite the hard work and preparation that went into the building Nuxt SaaS Kit, we hit a major snag: dealing with the bureaucratic process of setting up a company account and verifying our business through LemonSqueezy. What seemed like a simple step ended up becoming a long, drawn-out process that has lingered for weeks.

The back-and-forth with verification, compliance, and documentation slowed everything down, and we’ve had to put the launch on hold until these hurdles are cleared. It was frustrating, to say the least. After pouring so much time and energy into the product, hitting a wall so close to the finish line felt like a major setback.

## What I Learned from the Delay

Although I didn’t achieve my main goal this month, there were still valuable lessons to be learned:

- External roadblocks happen. No matter how much you plan, some things are simply out of your control. The key is to stay flexible and keep moving forward, even if it means adjusting your timelines.

- Patience is a skill. This month tested my patience, but it also reminded me that success doesn’t always happen on the timeline we want. While the delay is disappointing, it’s also part of the process.

- The Importance of Mental Resilience. August was mentally tough. Dealing with these hurdles on top of other personal issues challenged my resilience. But I’ve learned that setbacks are part of the journey, and it’s how we respond to them that matters most.

- Your location does matter. If you're in a developed country, you should consider yourself incredibly lucky. What might appear to be straightforward in one country might be a monumental problem to scale in another, especially in developing nations.

## Small Wins and Progress

While the delays were disheartening, I found other ways to stay motivated and make progress:

- I used the extra time to polish Nuxt SaaS Kit, adding small features, updating the codebase, and improving documentation. We’re also toying with the idea of giving early access to a few indie hackers in exchange for feedback and testimonials.

- While the delays with Nuxt SaaS Kit have been frustrating, they’ve also given me time to brainstorm our next product. Though still in the early stages, work has begun and we have identified potential users. I’m excited about its potential!

- One of the biggest challenges for me has been overcoming my anxiety about building in public and growing my social presence, but I’m making progress. Each post and comment is a small win, and I'm committed to pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

## Moving Forward

My primary goal for September is to push through these remaining hurdles and finally launch Nuxt SaaS Kit. In addition, our next product is starting to gather steam, and I’m hopeful to share more updates on that soon.

## Final Thoughts

August didn’t go as planned, and that’s okay. This journey is about learning from both the successes and the challenges. I’m still committed to the goals I set at the start of this newsletter, and while delays are part of the game, I won’t let them define the outcome.

Thanks for sticking with me on this journey. Hopefully, next month I’ll have better news to share with you all.

If you’re also working on a project, whether big or small, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s build together!

Until next time, stay patient and keep building.

Onwards to August and beyond!
