After [August's](/blog/august-2024-overcoming-hurdles-and-finding-silver-linings) challenges with bureaucratic hurdles, September brought some welcome progress. While the month wasn't filled with dramatic changes, we managed to overcome one of our biggest obstacles and started gathering feedback on Nuxt SaaS Kit.

## Pushing Forward with Nuxt SaaS Kit

After weeks of struggling with the business account verification, we decided to try a different approach and used an individual business account instead, as individual account verifications tend to be quicker and involve far fewer bureaucratic steps. The verification was approved within a week, a reminder that when one path is blocked, alternative routes are often worth exploring.

With the payment verification hurdle cleared, we began sharing Nuxt SaaS Kit in private groups, reaching out to indie developers, SaaS builders, and others who might find the starter kit useful.

The response has been encouraging. While this soft-launch approach has not generated any sales yet, we have received invaluable feedback about improving our landing page and refining our offering.

## Moving Forward

The goal for October is to push forward with final refinements based on feedback and, at last, move toward an official launch for Nuxt SaaS Kit. And, of course, it would be exciting to see our first customer purchase a license.

This newsletter is supposed to be a monthly recap of my journey in building an independent business. However, I haven’t been as timely as I’d like, often sharing updates later than planned. Moving forward, I’ll publish each month's recap on the first of the following month. This means that the next issue will be sent out in five days. Stay tuned!

## Final Thoughts

September wasn't filled with big milestones, but it reminded me that progress often comes in smaller steps. Breaking through the payment barrier and starting to gather real user feedback are significant achievements, even if they might not seem as flashy as a full launch.

Thanks for continuing to follow this journey. If you're working on your projects, I'd love to hear about them.

Until next time, keep building!
